# Changelog

## Upcoming features/tests

v1 targets a polished tool for generating the base ExoMol template only. Broadening and photodissociation data will get their own def-template structures in a future v2, once the tool is generalized to support multiple template types.

1. **Cross-platform CI smoke test** — GitHub Actions matrix (`ubuntu-latest` / `windows-latest` / `macos-latest` × Python 3.12, on push/PR to `main`) running `--init` + build against `samples/COmet` and `samples/AloHa/27Al-1H`. Strict diff against the committed `samples/AloHa/27Al-1H/ref/*.def`/`*.def.json`; COmet checked for clean exit only (no committed reference yet). Validates the 0.5.3 Windows/macOS fixes on real runners instead of Linux-side simulation.
2. **ExoMol sample downloader** — ExoMol's public API can supply already-published datasets along with their existing `.def`/`.def.json` files. A small downloader would give more verification fixtures beyond `COmet`/`AloHa`, feeding the same CI matrix above once it exists.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-15 — CAS registry number auto-fill

### Added
- **`cas.py`** — new module, `cas_rn_from_inchikey()` looks up a CAS Registry Number by InChIKey via the [CAS Common Chemistry API](https://commonchemistry.cas.org/api). Implemented as a ~15-line `urllib`/`json` call rather than the `PyComChem` package originally suggested for this — that package's `comchem/__init__.py` does a hard top-level `import cairosvg` (needed only for its unrelated image-export feature), which would have pulled in `cairosvg`/`cairocffi`/`pillow`/`cffi`/`pycparser`/`cssselect2`/`defusedxml`/`tinycss2`/`webencodings` (9 packages) for functionality this project doesn't use
- **`.env` support** — `cas._load_dotenv()` reads a gitignored `KEY=VALUE` `.env` file in the project root and populates `os.environ` (only for keys not already set), so `CAS_API_KEY` doesn't need to be exported in every shell session. No `python-dotenv` dependency added for one variable. `.env` added to `.gitignore`
- **`extractor.main_isotopologue_slug(iso_slugs)`** — returns the isotopologue built from each element's most naturally abundant isotope (via the same `mendeleev` abundance data already used for nuclear spin degeneracy), e.g. picks `1H2-16O` over `2H2-16O`/`1H2-18O` for water, `12C-16O` over `13C-16O` for carbon monoxide
- **`context.run_build`** — looks up the CAS RN once per dataset by the *base* (non-isotopic) InChIKey (derived from the dataset-level SMILES — the same molecule `derive_iso_inchi` already uses), and writes it only to the main isotopologue's `.def`/`.def.json`. Minor (isotopically substituted) isotopologues are left blank, since CAS Common Chemistry registers the parent molecule, not isotope-labeled variants — confirmed against `samples/AloHa`, where AlH's registered entry (CAS `13967-22-1`) uses the base InChIKey rather than an isotope-labeled one. A user-supplied `cas_registry_number` in the `.inp` (dataset- or isotopologue-level) always takes precedence and is never overwritten
- **README / `.inp` template** — `cas_registry_number` field docs updated to describe the auto-fill behavior, the main-isotopologue-only scope, and the `CAS_API_KEY`/`.env` setup

### Verified
- `python3 cas.py` self-check passes (mocked: single match, zero matches, ambiguous multi-match)
- Live API smoke-tested with a real `CAS_API_KEY`: aspirin (`BSYNRYMUTXBXSQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N` → `50-78-2`) resolves correctly; water (`XLYOFNOQVPJJNP-UHFFFAOYSA-N`) correctly returns no match (30 loosely-related substances — hydrates/clusters/isotopologues — trigger the ambiguous-match guard rather than guessing)
- Full `--init` → build against `samples/AloHa/27Al-1H`: output CAS RN (`13967-22-1`) now matches the committed reference exactly; all other diffs are the pre-existing ones already documented in 0.5.4 (unrelated to this change)
- Full `--init` → build against `samples/COmet`: output byte-identical to the committed reference (the ion isn't in Common Chemistry's database, so the field is correctly left blank, changing nothing)
- `extractor.main_isotopologue_slug` spot-checked against water and CO isotopologue sets (see Added, above)
- Bad/missing API key against the live endpoint: logs a warning, returns `None`, does not crash the build

## [0.5.4] — 2026-07-15 — Python 3.8 compatibility backport

### Changed
- **Minimum Python version lowered from 3.10 to 3.8** — the codebase used PEP 604 union syntax (`X | None`, 12 occurrences) and PEP 585 generics (`list[...]`/`dict[...]`/`tuple[...]`, 49 occurrences) throughout type annotations, both of which raise `TypeError` at import time on Python < 3.9/3.10. Since every occurrence was confined to annotations (no runtime `isinstance`/introspection on these types anywhere in the codebase), added `from __future__ import annotations` (PEP 563, supported since 3.7) as the first statement in `context.py`, `extractor.py`, `merger.py`, `renderer.py`, `inchi.py`, `validator.py`, and `inp_handler.py` — defers all annotations to strings, no per-annotation rewrite needed
- **`create_def.py`** — replaced `argparse.BooleanOptionalAction` (3.9+ only) with a plain `--no-verbose-input` / `store_false` flag; matches what the README already documented (the auto-generated `--verbose-input` positive form was never documented or needed)
- **`requirements.txt`** pins lowered to versions with `Requires-Python` floors at or below 3.8: `pandas` 2.3.3 → 2.0.3, `mendeleev` 1.1.0 → 0.16.2, `rdkit` 2026.3.3 → 2024.3.5 (latest release with a `cp38` wheel; PyPI declares no `Requires-Python` for any rdkit release)
- **README** — "Requires Python 3.10+" → "Requires Python 3.8+"
- **`samples/AloHa/AloHa.inp`** filled in with real values (point_group, irreps, quantum_case_label, max_temperature, etc.) — previously checked in as a blank `--init`-generated template, which meant this fixture couldn't reproduce the checked-in `samples/AloHa/27Al-1H/ref/*.def*` output

### Verified
No Python 3.8/3.9 interpreter was available locally or on the host, so verification used `podman` (already installed, rootless, on the Fedora host via `flatpak-spawn --host`) against the official `python:3.8` Docker Hub image (3.8.20):
- All 8 modules import cleanly under 3.8.20 with the new pins
- Full `--init` + build pipeline against `samples/COmet`: output `.def`/`.def.json` byte-identical to the committed reference
- Full pipeline against `samples/AloHa/27Al-1H`: ran without error; remaining diffs vs. `ref/` traced to the reconstructed `.inp` not being the literal original (missing optional `cas_registry_number`/`doi`, a `continuum` flag set differently, an older `version_date`) plus a pre-existing renderer limitation (no `broad`/broadening section support at all) — none caused by this backport
- Directly compared `mendeleev==0.16.2` vs. the old `1.1.0` pin for the isotope masses used in this dataset (Al-27, H-1): bit-for-bit identical (`27.989363439898` both), confirming the dependency downgrade introduces no precision regression

## [0.5.3] — 2026-07-14 — Windows/macOS compatibility pass

### Fixed
- **Missing `encoding="utf-8"` on text file opens in `extractor.py`** — `extract_states_info`, `_load_state_energies`, and `extract_transitions_info` opened `.states`/`.trans` files without an explicit encoding, falling back to the platform's locale-preferred encoding (typically not UTF-8 on Windows); a non-ASCII byte in a data file that read fine on Linux could raise `UnicodeDecodeError` on Windows
- **UTF-8 BOM breaks `.inp` parsing on Windows** — `inp_handler._read_sections` now opens with `encoding="utf-8-sig"`; previously, a BOM added by a Windows text editor on save would prepend `﻿` to the first line, causing the first `[section]` header to go undetected and be reported as a missing section
- **No `.gitattributes`** — added, marking `.bz2`/`.states`/`.trans`/`.pf` as binary as a backstop against Git's `core.autocrlf` (default on Windows) corrupting them on checkout

### Changed
- **Removed the single-implementation renderer registry** — `renderer.py`'s `BaseRenderer` ABC, `REGISTRY`, and `get_renderer()` factory existed for exactly one format (ExoMol); replaced with a plain `render()` function. The now-pointless `--format` CLI flag was dropped from `create_def.py`/`context.py`/README along with it
- **Deduplicated file-discovery and `.bz2`-decompression helpers** — `_data_files`/`_open_maybe_bz2` were defined identically in both `validator.py` and `extractor.py`; `extractor.py` now imports them from `validator.py`
- **Deduplicated the diacritic-stripping helper** — `renderer._to_ascii` and `inp_handler`'s local `_ascii` closure were identical; consolidated into `config.to_ascii()`, used by both
- **Simplified `slug_to_formula`** — replaced a 20-line char-list reverse/insert/reverse routine with a short `rstrip`-based helper; verified against known slug shapes (`27Al-1H`, `12C-16O2`, `12C-16O_p`, etc.)
- **Removed dead code in `merger.py`** — `_set_nested()` was defined but never called; `_REQUIRED_PATHS` had a duplicate `("dataset", "states", "max_energy")` entry

Verified by running the full `--init` → build pipeline against the `COmet` sample end-to-end: output `.def` is byte-identical to the committed reference, and a BOM-prefixed `.inp` now builds successfully (previously would misreport a missing `[options]` section).

## [0.5.2] — 2026-07-14 — Fixed bug that appeared in ExoTea

### Added
- **Installation instructions in README** — Quick start guide now includes venv setup and `pip install -r requirements.txt` steps for Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Fixed
- **`rdkit` missing from `requirements.txt`** — added; it's imported directly in `inchi.py` but was absent from the pinned dependency list

## [0.5.1] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Extraction progress output** — `--init` prints `Extracting data for N isotopologue(s)...` with a per-isotopologue `  <iso_slug>... done` line as each file is read, so the user can see progress during large file processing
- **"Next steps" footer in `.inp`** — generated `.inp` files end with a comment block reminding the user what command to run after filling in the file
- **Batch temp cache check in build** — `run_build` now checks that all temp `.def.json` cache files exist before starting any render work, listing every missing file at once rather than halting on the first one mid-loop
- **`--force` "nothing to remove" feedback** — if `--init --force` finds no existing `.inp` or temp cache files, it now prints a confirmation instead of silently continuing

### Changed
- **Centralized validation message strings** — all user-facing error and warning text is now collected in `_VALIDATION_ERRORS` and `_VALIDATION_WARNINGS` dicts at the top of `inp_handler.py`, and `_VALIDATOR_ERRORS` at the top of `validator.py`; logic in `validate_inp` and `validate_iso_files` calls `.format()` on these strings rather than embedding them inline — edit messages without touching validation logic
- **`--init` completion summary** rewritten to print dataset name, isotopologue list, temp cache paths one per line, and explicit numbered "Next steps" rather than a Python list repr
- **`quantum_case_label` validation errors** now include a link to `https://www.exomol.com/data/quantum-cases/`
- **`run_build` error/warning display** extracted into a shared `_print_errors()` helper in `context.py`

### Fixed
- **Error display double-indent** — validation error continuation lines (hints starting with `→`) were being indented twice; messages in `_VALIDATION_ERRORS` no longer carry leading whitespace, so the display loop's 5-space prefix produces consistent single-level indentation
- **Broken warning sentence** — the `num_quantum_types = 0` soft warning had two sentences concatenated without a newline separator, causing them to run together on one line

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-09

### Changed
- **Flat working directory** — the required `{work_dir}/{iso_slug}/` subdirectory structure has been removed; all data files now live directly in the working directory alongside generated outputs. Users place files in any directory and the tool auto-detects everything from the file names.
- **File-name-based discovery** — `--init` and build scan the working directory for `*.states[.bz2]` files named `{iso_slug}__{ds_name}.states`; `ds_name` and the full isotopologue list are derived from these names. No manual configuration of dataset name or isotopologue list is required.
- **`DefContext`** — `ds_name` and `iso_slugs` are now discovered via `validator.discover_dataset()` at construction time rather than read from the directory name and subdirectory listing; `isotopologue_dirs()` replaced by `isotopologue_slugs()`.
- **Output paths are flat** — `.def`, `.def.json`, `__temp.def.json`, and `.inp` files are all written directly into the working directory (`{iso_slug}__{ds_name}.def` etc.).
- **`extractor` functions** — all functions that previously accepted `iso_dir: Path` now accept `(work_dir: Path, iso_slug: str, ds_name: str)` and search for files by name prefix rather than by directory.
- **`validator.validate_iso_files`** replaces `validate_iso_dir` — validates that the working directory contains exactly one `.states` file, exactly one `.pf` file, and at least one `.trans` file for each discovered iso_slug/ds_name combination; provides clear error messages including the expected filename pattern when files are missing.
- **`validator.discover_dataset`** — new function that scans `work_dir` for `*.states` files, parses `iso_slug`/`ds_name` from their stems, and raises `ValidationError` if no qualifying files are found or if multiple dataset names are detected.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Nuclear spin degeneracy validation** — `extractor.nuclear_spin_degeneracy(iso_slug)` computes g_ns = Π(2Iᵢ+1) from mendeleev nuclear spin values (handles fraction strings such as `"5/2"`); used in `validate_inp`:
  - Error if any irrep degeneracy exceeds g_ns
  - Error if molecule has no equivalent nuclei and any irrep degeneracy ≠ g_ns (all irreps must share the same weight for heteronuclear molecules)
  - Equivalent-nuclei case (ortho/para split) is flagged informatively but not constrained beyond the g_ns ceiling
- **g_ns hint in `.inp` header** — `--init` auto-derives g_ns per isotopologue and adds it to the auto-derived header block with guidance on expected degeneracy values
- **Half-integer column type** — `summarise_states_columns` now detects columns where all values are multiples of 0.5 (e.g. half-integer J) and labels them `half-integer` rather than `float`

### Changed
- **SMILES and InChI promoted to `[dataset]` level** — base (non-isotopic) SMILES and InChI are now single fields in the `[dataset]` section, shared across all isotopologues; isotope mass numbers are assigned per-isotopologue automatically at build time via `inchi.derive_iso_inchi`; users no longer fill in per-isotopologue SMILES or InChI/InChIKey
- **Base SMILES and InChI auto-derived at `--init` time** — when SMILES can be auto-generated from the iso_slug, the corresponding base InChI is also computed; both are pre-filled in `[dataset]`
- **`generate_blank_inp`** accepts `base_smiles` and `base_inchi` as direct parameters; removes the previous stash that wrote `base_smiles` as a non-template field into `.def.json`
- **`run_init` signature** — removed unused `format_name` parameter
- **States column summary moved inline** — per-column type/range info is now shown as a trailing `# col N  type  range` comment on each quantum label line rather than in a separate block; unassigned columns appear as blank placeholder lines with the summary comment
- **Quantum label parser** strips inline `#` comments from label lines so the new inline column hints are ignored during parsing
- **Comment text centralised** — all user-facing instruction strings moved from `generate_blank_inp` into a module-level `_INP_COMMENTS` dict with a `_comment_lines` helper; edit comment text in one place without touching generation logic
- **Blank DOI now accepted** — `validate_inp` no longer errors on an empty `doi`; format is only validated when a non-empty value is provided

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added
- **`inchi.py`** — new module owning all InChI/SMILES logic (previously attempted via PubChem; now fully local):
  - `smiles_from_atoms(atoms, charge)` — auto-generates isotopologue SMILES from the iso_slug; chain `[massSymbol]...` notation for diatomics and all-distinct-element molecules; returns `None` for polyatomics with any repeated non-H element (user must supply)
  - `inchi_from_smiles(smiles)` — derives InChI + InChIKey via RDKit with `sanitize=False` fallback for radicals and non-octet molecules (e.g. AlH)
  - `inchikey_from_inchi(inchi)` — derives InChIKey from a manually-provided InChI string
- **`smiles` field** in `[isotopologue.*]` section of `.inp`: auto-filled where possible, with comment explaining whether it was derived or requires manual input
- **Three InChI/InChIKey workflows** at build time: (1) SMILES present → derive both; (2) InChI present, InChIKey blank → derive InChIKey; (3) all three provided manually → use as-is
- **SMILES validation** in `validate_inp`: if SMILES is provided and RDKit fails to produce InChI/InChIKey, a clear error is reported with instructions to correct the SMILES and clear/update the related fields
- **`--force` flag** for `--init`: deletes existing `.inp` and temp `.def.json` cache files before regenerating (without `--force`, existing `.inp` is never overwritten)
- **Soft warnings** in `validate_inp`: function now returns `(errors, warnings)` instead of a flat error list; warnings display before the build and require a `y/N` confirmation to proceed (errors still block immediately)
- Warning raised when `num_quantum_types = 0` — no quantum coupling-scheme namespace prefixes detected; non-blocking since some datasets legitimately have none

### Changed
- `extractor.py`: `extract_all` now accepts `smiles`, `inchi`, `inchikey` parameters (passed in from `context.py`; not re-derived internally)
- `extractor.py`: new public helper `slug_to_hill_formula_and_charge(iso_slug)` — builds Hill formula and extracts ionic charge from an iso_slug
- InChI/SMILES derivation moved entirely out of `extractor.py` into `inchi.py`; `context.py` orchestrates — SMILES generated once per isotopologue, PubChem removed

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- `--no-verbose-input` flag for `--init`: generates a comment-free `.inp` (states preview always retained)
- `quantum_case_label` validated against the exhaustive ExoMol list: `dcs`, `dos`, `lpcs`, `lpos`, `asymcs`, `asymos`, `stos`, `stcs`, `sphcs`, `sphos`
- `SourceType` and `Ecal` added to the standard Auxiliary label library — auto-fill on parse, no explicit format required
- States preview first-5-rows rendered via `df.to_string()` (column-aligned) instead of manual token join

### Fixed
- `shared_quantum_labels` bool parse now wrapped in try/except so `validate_inp` always runs even on invalid values
- `[quantum_labels*]` section lookup falls back to first matching section when `shared_quantum_labels = true`, so the section name doesn't need to be changed after toggling the flag
- States preview moved to just above the `[quantum_labels.*]` section (was above `[isotopologue.*]`)

### Validation
- DOI must start with `10.` and contain `/` (or be the literal `None`)
- `max_temperature` must be > 0
- Irrep degeneracy must be ≥ 0 (negative rejected; 0 accepted)
- `inchikey` must match the `XXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX-X` regex pattern
- Unknown Auxiliary labels without explicit format strings now produce a clear error

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-26

Initial structured release. Replaced the Excel-based `create_def_files.py` / `def_input.xlsm` workflow with a plain-text `.inp` pipeline.

### Added
- Two-step workflow: `--init` (extract + cache + generate template) and build (parse + merge + render)
- `create_def.py` — thin CLI with `--init`, `--format`, `--log-level` flags
- `context.py` — `DefContext` dataclass + `run_init` / `run_build` orchestration
- `extractor.py` — stateless extraction from `.states`, `.trans`, `.pf`; states column summary
- `inp_handler.py` — blank `.inp` generation (aligned columns, states preview, standard label lookup); `.inp` parsing with auto-detection of availability flags
- `merger.py` — deep merge of auto-derived and user fields; completeness validation
- `renderer.py` — `BaseRenderer` ABC + `ExoMolRenderer`
- `validator.py` — work-dir and iso-dir structure checks
- Standard label auto-fill from `standard_label_structure.json` (formats + descriptions)
- `shared_quantum_labels` option for datasets with multiple isotopologues sharing the same quantum label list
